## Overview

### The challenge

- in Project I finally escaped tutorials hell and actually built something by myself and the challenge was to create the app in a way that it will function the same way I used to do by Pen and Paper..

- I add a Task, descripe it, then when I'am done I write down how much time did it take and this is exactly what this app does
